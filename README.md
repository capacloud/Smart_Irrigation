### Introduction

The aim of the project is to produced an irrigation design on the grounds of the parameters provided by
the user. These parameters are then used to construct the design such that the pressure losses and the
cost of the components used are optimal.
The Project consists of the user giving the inputs as per the requirements of the design. The inputs
required are given below.
The application consists of a server-client model where the server uses NodeJS and the client is HTML
and JavaScript.
The server will record the response from the user and use that data to do the required calculations for
finding out the pressure difference. This data will be sent to the client and the client will use it to draw
the network. The client also has the job of calculating the number of components and writing them to a
csv file.
